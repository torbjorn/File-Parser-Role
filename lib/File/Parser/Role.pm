=head1 NAME

File::Parser::Role - Read and prepare parsing of file (or glob) data
from some source

=head1 VERSION

This document describes File::Parser::Role version 0.2.0 This is a
Moo::Role for reading (and then parsing) single data files. It makes
the constructor support 3 kinds of file sources:

=over

=item a path to a readable file

=item a file handle or anything that can be read like one

=item a scalar references to content

=back

It also provides a method "fh" that gives an at least readable file
handle to the contents of the file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyClassThatDoesStuffToAFile;

    sub parse {
        my $self = shift;

        # ... do stuff, $self->fh available
    }

    with "File::Parser::Role";

    ## ... and in some nearby code:

    my $obj = MyClassThatDoesStuffToAFile->new("some_file.txt");
    # or #
    my $obj = MyClassThatDoesStuffToAFile->new(file => "some_file.txt");
    ## optinally:

    my $obj = MyClassThatDoesStuffToAFile->new( file => "some_file.txt", encoding => "utf8" );
    ## encoding can be anything that binmode's encoding() can understand.

    print $obj->filename; # "some_file.txt"
    print $obj->size;     # size of some_file.txt

    ## - OR -

    my $fh = IO::File->new( "< some_file.txt" );
    ## you are now responsible for encoding on this handle!

    my $obj = MyClassThatDoesStuffToAFile->new( file => $fh );

    ## no filename nor file size available

    ## - OR -

    my $file_content = read_file( "some_file.txt" );
    my $obj = MyClassThatDoesStuffToAFile->new( file => \$file_content );

    ## you are also responsible for encoding on this data
    ## no file name nor file size available

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides all the bare necessities, and then some, that you
expect when you want to parse or otherwise handle a chunk of content
typically provided as a file.

It is motivated by and ideal for objects that parse files.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 new

The constructor is meant to be all expected kinds of flexible:

=over

=item * new("file")

=item * new($fh)

=item * new( file => "file", encoding => "utf8" ); # also works with: C<new({ ... })>

=item * new( \"some content" )

=back

Construction tests the argument and if it's a path to a file reachable
on the local file system records its C<filename> and C<size> in those
two attributes.

When it checks if the argument if a local filename, it checks "$file",
allowing objects that stringify to paths to work correctly. This
applies among others to Path::Tiny.

If a reference to something is passed (or an object), it is assumed to
be something that can be read with <> and passed for a handle.

=head2 fh

Returns ro handle (IO::File for files, IO::String for content) to the
contents of the input, be it a file or a sclar reference or an already
opened file handle

If the input argument is assumed to be a readable handle to content,
it is passed straight through with this method.

=head2 parse

A required method that you must write! It is run in BUILD

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< Cannot work with input file >>

The file argument is neither an existing file, an object nor a
reference to content
